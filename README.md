Since [the old repo](https://github.com/Gent00man/logos) is not tended, we will assume it is deprecated.

[Ricing guideline](https://github.com/install-logos/rice/wiki/logos-ricing-guideline)

I have studied why the other OS developed by /g/ **failed**. Technically, most of them, if not all, were [parochially successful](http://static.jiyuu.xyz/video/ppkg.htm) with a few stable .iso releases but they failed to leave prints on the sands of time. Lo/g/os cannot be another Jiyuu or Clover OS, which failed because they have nothing to offer: ***merely changing the name, logo and adding a few bloatwares is plagiarism and ultimately meaningless***. Lo/g/os, is a customizable Archlinux that can be installed like Ubuntu. **You choose WM theme and choose Firefox theme and choose VIM theme and you are done**

Lo/g/os offers a db full of custom themes: pre-configured packages installed with a simple command(`rice vim-light` or `rice openbox-mlp`) like pacman.

**What do we need to build?**
* a rice db / repo
* a Package Manager for rice db (can also be used on other distros)

**What is lo/g/os?**
* a bloatware-free Arch distro with an installer and UI manager

**Who is lo/g/os for?**
* anyone who needs a quick installation of Archlinux
* anyone who needs a riced theme

**How do you propose we achieve this?**
* The arch way: ***does exactly what it needs to, no extras, bloat, no choosing for the user***
* Any ricable config is uploadable
